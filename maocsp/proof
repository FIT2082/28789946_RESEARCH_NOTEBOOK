 Let L = FootyScore;
Assume L is regular, and hence there exists an N such that <pumping lemma>

Consider (1^N, 1^N, 6(1^N) + 1^N), which is an element of L;

For all xyz such that xyz = w, and y!=empty, |xy| <= N:
    // not sure if this is allowed bc w is usually just one case...
    y must be 1. '(1^k' or 2. '1^k' where 1 <= k <= N
    xyyz then must be:
        1: '(1^(N)(1^(N), 1^N, 6(1^N) + 1^N)'
        2: '(1^(N + k), 1^N, 6(1^N) + 1^N)'
    In (1), we find that the initial bracket is repeated within the string, breaking L. Contradiction
    and in (2), we find that the 6g + b = p property is not fulfiled. Contradiction.

Hence, xyyz is not an element of L. 
Thus L is not regular.
