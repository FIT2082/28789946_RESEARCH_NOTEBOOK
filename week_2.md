Please see main repo README for an overview of the project. 
# Project Explanation
This research project regards the sonification of constraint problem solving algorithms. Constraint problems are mathematically defined problems, generally NP-Hard problems, that require searching a set domain for optimal solutions based on a set of constraints. Some examples of constraint problems are N-Queens, Map Colouring and Scheduling. In general, this project aims to improve constraint problem solving by seeing if the sonified output can lead to any information which could be used to reduce search space/time.

# Initial meeting
During the first meeting Adam, Guido, Kevin  and I discussed the context of this research topic. We were introduced to the idea of constraint programming [1] and advised to familiarise ourselves with MiniZinc. 
This research topic is very explorative and there are many possibilities to the approach we can take. These possibilities can be encapsulates into 2 main themes. 
1. Physics based: An exploration into the physical attributes, that is - wavelength size, frequency, of the sonified algorithms. 
2. Music Theory: Analysing the musical structure of the sonified output.
